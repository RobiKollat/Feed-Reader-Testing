## Feed Reader Testing ##


## Description ##

Using Jasmine to write tests for a given web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

Consturcted tests that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL and name are defined and that the URL and name are not empty.

Constructed a test suite named '"The menu"

Ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
Ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
Constructed a test suite named `"Initial Entries"'

Ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
Consturcted a test suite named "New Feed Selection"

Ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
